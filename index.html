            are,
            where
            we'regoing, what'simportant to us, and, yes, even our favorite movie. If you haven't placed the
            quote yet,
            it's from the movie'Shawshank Redemption'. Now, I know that Tim Robbins was dealing with some very
            drastic
            life choices, but I've always loved the sentiment. </p>

            <p> Now that I've gotten the important stuff out of the way, let me tell you a little about
              myself. I was
              born Lynn Cunningham in the picturesque little town of Pinetop, Arizona. For the first few years of
              my life
              I bounced between Arizona and Texas where my parents worked in the child-care industry. This meant my
              first
              homes were in orphanages, but unlike the other children in residence, I had both of my parents. It
              was a
              pretty unorthodox adolescence.</P>
            <p> In 1997 I moved to Tucson. I married my husband and we formed Affordable Fence and Gates which is an
              ornamental iron contracting business. It started with just the two of us: my husband handled the
              building
              and installation and I managed the books. It has grown quite a bit over the years. We no longer work
              out of
              our home and we now have 25 employees on our team.</p>
            <p> I have two incredible kids. My daughter is 18 and attending U of A and my son is a 16 year old
              Junior at Canyon Del Oro High School. I love to scuba dive, hike, read, build our business and travel.
              My
              dream is to one day retire on a boat somewhere in the Mediteranian Ocean while I freelance as a web
              designer.</p>
